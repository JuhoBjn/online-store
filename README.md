## Deployed website

The website is deployed on Render. The site is hosted on free-tier instances which shut down with inactiviy so the first signup or login will take a long time.

Frontend: [https://onlinestore-frontend-stg.onrender.com](https://onlinestore-frontend-stg.onrender.com)

Backend (healthcheck): [https://onlinestore-backend-stg.onrender.com/healthz](https://onlinestore-backend-stg.onrender.com/healthz)

[^1]: `mysql` is used as part of [inserting test data when running backend tests locally using `npm run test:clean`](backend/localtestrun.sh) and [`mysqldump` is used for exporting the database schema](https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate#exporting-schema-file).
